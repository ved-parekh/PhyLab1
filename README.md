# PhyLab1
This repository contains the code for the Physics Lab 1 (PHY 1010) course at the Ashoka University Sonipat. The following experiments were conducted:

1. Observing the properties of a Simple Pendulum
2. Identifying the components of an electronic BlackBox
3. Diffraction Gratings
4. Observing a rainbow formed by passing light through a spherical waterdroplet
5. Properties of a metallic Spring
6. Carey Foster Bridge

Note: This is not official code from the University, this is my personal code written when I took the course. There might be more efficient methods that can be used when analysing data, please be wary of errors. Some of these files might not contain the code for the entire experiment as the coding involved with each experiment was divided between my lab partner and I
